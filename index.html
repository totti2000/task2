          <h1>Mission</h1>
          <p>Whatever be the actual state of the skill, dexterity, and judgment with which labour is applied in any nation, the abundance or scantiness of itsannual supply must depend, during the continuance of that state, uponthe proportion between the number of those who are annually employedin useful labour, and that of those who are not so employed. The numberof useful and productive labourers, it will hereafter appear, is every wherein proportion to the quantity of capital stock which is employed in settingthem to work, and to the particular way in which it is so employed. TheSecond Book, therefore, treats of the nature of capital stock, of the mannerin which it is gradually accumulated, and of the different quantities oflabour which it puts into motion, according to the different ways in whichit is employed. </p>

          <p>THEannual labour of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it with all the necessaries and conveniences of life which it annually con-sumes, and which consist always either in the immediate produce of thatlabour, or in what is purchased with that produce from other nations.According therefore, as this produce, or what is purchased with it, bears a greater or smaller proportion to the number of those who are to consumeit, the nation will be better or worse supplied with all the necessaries andconveniences for which it has occasion. </p>
